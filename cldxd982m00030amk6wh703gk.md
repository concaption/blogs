# Shifting your career toward data science

Are you ready to embark on a journey of learning and growth in the field of data science? If so, you are in the right place! In this guide, I will cover some key principles and strategies for effective learning in the field of data science.

Whether you are just starting out on your data science journey, or you are an experienced professional looking to deepen your knowledge and skills, this guide is for you. I will cover topics such as breaking down large goals into smaller tasks, finding a mentor, and building a strong portfolio of work.

By following the principles outlined in this guide, you can set yourself up for success in your data science learning journey. So let's get started!

## üß† Find a reason to learn

Data science is a rapidly growing field with plenty of exciting opportunities. But before you get started, it's important to find a reason that motivates you to learn and succeed.

For me, my reason to learn data science was inspired by my interest in self-driving cars. In 2018, I watched some videos about this technology and became fascinated by how it worked. As I delved deeper into the topic, I realized that self-driving cars rely on computer vision, which is a branch of artificial intelligence. This sparked my curiosity about the fundamental building blocks of AI, and I began exploring ways to learn more about this field.

As I rode a train back to my university, I stumbled upon the "Elements of AI" course [**https://www.elementsofai.com/**](https://www.elementsofai.com/). This course provided a great introduction to the basics of AI, and after discussing my interests with a friend, I realized that data science skills would be key to achieving my goals.

So, I started learning data science to understand AI in self-driving cars. But your reason to learn data science might be different. Maybe you're interested in analyzing data to improve business decisions, or you want to use data to solve complex problems in healthcare or finance. Whatever your motivation, it's important to find a reason that inspires you to learn and grow as a data scientist. So, take some time to think about what drives you, and use that motivation to guide your learning journey.

## üî∞Nail the fundamentals

It's true ‚Äì you can't run before you learn to walk. When it comes to learning data science, it's important to start with the fundamentals before moving on to more advanced topics. Not only will this help you build a strong foundation of knowledge, but it will also make it easier for you to understand and apply more complex concepts later on.

So, where do you start? One of the key fundamentals in data science is statistics. A strong understanding of statistics is essential for analyzing data, making predictions, and drawing conclusions.

To learn the fundamentals of data science, it's also a good idea to practice using real data. You can find a wide range of datasets online, or you can try using tools like Google's BigQuery to explore large datasets. As you work with data, be sure to take advantage of online resources like Stack Overflow and Dataquest to help you troubleshoot any issues that come up.

By focusing on the fundamentals and actively practicing your skills, you'll be well on your way to becoming a successful data scientist.

## **üöÄ Take it o**ne b**arrel at a time**

In data science, there are many different topics and techniques to learn, and it can be overwhelming to try to learn everything at once. By taking it one barrel at a time, you can focus on one topic or skill at a time, and build your knowledge and expertise gradually.

For example, if your goal is to become proficient in machine learning, you might start by focusing on foundational concepts such as linear algebra and probability. Once you have a strong foundation, you can move on to more advanced topics such as neural networks and deep learning.

Similarly, if you are working on a data science project, you might break it down into smaller tasks such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. This can help you stay organized and focused, and can help you make progress one step at a time.

The key is to stay focused, consistent, and patient, and to keep moving forward one step at a time. By taking it one barrel at a time, you can make steady progress and eventually achieve your goals.

## ‚§¥Ô∏èHave a mentor

Having a mentor can be an invaluable resource for anyone, especially in the field of data science where there is so much to learn and so many different directions to take. A mentor can provide guidance, support, and encouragement as you navigate your way through the field.

There are many ways to find a mentor in data science. You might ask someone you admire or respect in the field if they would be willing to mentor you. You could also join a professional organization or attend industry events where you can meet and network with potential mentors.

When looking for a mentor, it's important to find someone who aligns with your goals and interests, and who has the time and willingness to commit to a mentorship relationship. It can also be helpful to have a clear idea of what you hope to get out of the mentorship, such as guidance on a specific project, advice on your career development, or general support and encouragement.

Remember that a mentor is not a replacement for your own hard work and learning, but rather someone who can provide additional guidance and support as you navigate the field. Having a mentor can be a valuable asset to your professional development, and can help you make the most of your data science journey.

## ü¶æLet the algorithms know

We are being fed the content by the algorithms of these tech giants. People get stuck in the local minima of the content by the algorithm whose aim is to increase product retention. You can also be part of the local minima of things you want to learn by letting the algorithm know that its product retention will increase when it recommends me this stuff.

This can be done in two ways. Either unfollow/unsubscribe/remove all useless media accounts/creators and add/follow/subscribe to people with your new interest.

The other way is to have two accounts. One account for learning and growth, one account for entertainment (songs, memes, seasons, vlogs, etc.)

Now coming to what platforms you should spend time on. I am ranking here the top three social media platforms for data science.

1. Twitter
    
2. YouTube
    
3. LinkedIn
    

## üèóÔ∏èPortfolio &gt;&gt; certificate

In the field of data science, it's important to have a portfolio of work that showcases your skills and accomplishments. A portfolio can include projects you have completed, papers you have written, or even code you have written. It's a way to demonstrate your expertise and capabilities to potential employers or clients.

While certificates and degrees can be important indicators of your knowledge and abilities, they are not a substitute for a strong portfolio of work. A well-crafted portfolio can speak more effectively to your skills and experience than a piece of paper.

That being said, there is nothing wrong with seeking out certificates and degrees in data science, and they can be valuable additions to your portfolio. Just be sure to focus on building a strong foundation of skills and experience through hands-on projects and learning opportunities, and use certificates and degrees as supplementary evidence of your knowledge and abilities.

Ultimately, a portfolio of work is the most effective way to demonstrate your expertise in data science and should be the focus of your efforts as you build your career in the field.
